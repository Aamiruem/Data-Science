Bitwise operators in Python are used to perform operations on the binary representations of integers. Here are the main bitwise operators:

AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation. The result bit is 1 if both corresponding bits are 1; otherwise, it's 0.

python
Copy
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
b = 3  # 0011 in binary
result = a & b  # 0001 in binary (1 in decimal)
print(result)  # Output: 1
OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation. The result bit is 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

python
Copy
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
b = 3  # 0011 in binary
result = a | b  # 0111 in binary (7 in decimal)
print(result)  # Output: 7
XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation. The result bit is 1 if the corresponding bits are different; otherwise, it's 0.

python
Copy
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
b = 3  # 0011 in binary
result = a ^ b  # 0110 in binary (6 in decimal)
print(result)  # Output: 6
NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation, which flips all the bits. This is a unary operator.

python
Copy
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
result = ~a  # 1010 in binary (in two's complement, this is -6 in decimal)
print(result)  # Output: -6
Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of the number to the left and fills in with 0s on the right. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2^n, where n is the number of bits shifted.

python
Copy
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
result = a << 1  # 1010 in binary (10 in decimal)
print(result)  # Output: 10
Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills in with 0s on the left (for unsigned numbers). This is equivalent to dividing the number by 2^n, where n is the number of bits shifted.

python
Copy
a = 5  # 0101 in binary
result = a >> 1  # 0010 in binary (2 in decimal)
print(result)  # Output: 2
Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates all the bitwise operators:

python
Copy
a = 10  # 1010 in binary
b = 4   # 0100 in binary

print("AND:", a & b)  # Output: 0 (0000 in binary)
print("OR:", a | b)   # Output: 14 (1110 in binary)
print("XOR:", a ^ b)  # Output: 14 (1110 in binary)
print("NOT a:", ~a)   # Output: -11 (in two's complement)
print("Left Shift:", a << 1)  # Output: 20 (10100 in binary)
print("Right Shift:", a >> 1)  # Output: 5 (0101 in binary)
Notes:
Bitwise operations are often used in low-level programming, such as device control, cryptography, and optimization tasks.

The ~ operator can be tricky because it involves the concept of two's complement, which is how negative numbers are represented in binary.
